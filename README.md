# cloverüçÄ: create autonomous drones easily

<img src="docs/assets/clover42-main.png" align="right" width="400px" alt="COEX Clover Drone">

Clover is an open source [ROS](https://www.ros.org)-based framework, providing user-friendly tools to control [PX4](https://px4.io)-powered drones. Clover is available as a ROS package, but is shipped mainly as a preconfigured image for Raspberry Pi. Once you've installed Raspberry Pi on your drone and flashed the image to its microSD card, taking the drone up in the air is a matter of minutes.

COEX Clover Drone is an educational programmable drone kit, suited perfectly for running clover software. The kit is shipped unassembled and includes Pixracer-compatible autopilot running PX4 firmware, Raspberry Pi 4 as a companion computer, a camera for computer vision navigation as well as additional sensors and peripheral devices. Batteries included.

The main documentation is available at [https://clover.coex.tech](https://clover.coex.tech/). Official website: [coex.tech/clover](https://coex.tech/clover).
